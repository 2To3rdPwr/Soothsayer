# Soothsayer
Soothsayer is a character generator and companion app for [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/preview/). Spend time handcrafting the perfect hero to take on MÖRK BORG's many perils, or simply press a button that spits out an unfortunate wretch to serve as your plaything. It makes no difference, as all will perish in time. Skip basic arithmetic with automatic attack, defense, and power rolls. Easily browse the list of weapons, armor, and other equipment, or create your own accursed artifacts. Don't use classes because you are not special. Don't use omens because fate smiles not upon you. Die deep in the guts of some massive fortress or lair. Easily create a new character and pick up right where you left off. Now available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twotothirdpower.morkborgcharactersheet)
